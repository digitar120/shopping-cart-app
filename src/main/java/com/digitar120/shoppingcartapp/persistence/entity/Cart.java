/**
 * This class holds information about a shopping cart and its linked Items. It is also bound to a User.
 * <p>There are a couple elements that were needed to make queries work, since the relation with Item is bidirectional.
 * There was a problem when querying for the full object of a Cart. At first, the query would simply fail, and when
 * tested without safeties, it would print an infinite loop between the two objects.</p>
 * <p>The JSON tools and relation rules used below solve this issue, and allow queries to behave normally.</p>
